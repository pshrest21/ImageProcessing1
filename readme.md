# Image Processing Project 1
In this project we will perform some image processing
1. We will read a .pgm extension image manually. No OpenCV used
2. We will change the spatial resolution of the image from 512x512 to 256x256. However, we will keep the size of the image to 512x512
3. Reduce spatial resolution to 128x128 and 64x64
4. Reduce the grayscale resolution from 8 bits per pixel to 6 bits per pixel
